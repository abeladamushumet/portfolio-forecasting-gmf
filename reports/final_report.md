Traditional financial models often fall short in capturing the complex, non-linear patterns inherent in time series financial data. This project addresses these challenges by introducing a comprehensive framework that leverages advanced machine learning techniques, specifically ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, for enhanced portfolio forecasting and optimization. The framework, dubbed "Portfolio Forecasting with GMF (Generative Modeling Framework)," integrates various stages of the data science pipeline, from raw data acquisition to sophisticated model evaluation and backtesting.

The primary objective of this initiative is to provide a robust, scalable, and data-driven solution for financial professionals. By automating data acquisition from reliable sources like Yahoo Finance, the framework ensures access to timely and relevant historical data. Subsequent rigorous data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, calculating key financial metrics such as daily returns, and identifying outliers, lay a solid foundation for reliable analysis. The core of the framework lies in its dual-model approach, employing both statistical (ARIMA) and deep learning (LSTM) methodologies to capture diverse temporal dependencies and improve forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, the project extends beyond mere prediction by incorporating tools for portfolio optimization, enabling users to construct portfolios that align with their risk-return objectives based on the generated forecasts. A dedicated backtesting framework allows for the systematic evaluation of model performance against historical data, providing critical insights into the efficacy and robustness of the proposed strategies. The modular design of the codebase, complemented by interactive Jupyter notebooks, fosters transparency, reproducibility, and ease of use, making this framework a valuable asset for advanced portfolio management.

## 4. Data Preparation

Data preparation is a foundational step in any data-driven project, especially in financial time series analysis where data quality directly impacts model performance. This framework employs a robust data preparation pipeline, encompassing automated data acquisition, comprehensive cleaning, and insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### 4.1 Data Extraction and Loading

The initial phase of data preparation involves the extraction and loading of historical financial data. The `src/data_loader.py` module is central to this process, designed to fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. As detailed in the `interim_report.md` [1], the project focuses on three key assets: Tesla (TSLA), Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), and S&P 500 ETF (SPY), with data covering the period from July 1, 2015, to July 31, 2025. The `fetch_asset_data` function within `data_loader.py` utilizes the `yfinance` library to download comprehensive historical data, including Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. This data is then saved locally in a structured format within the `data/raw/` directory, ensuring data persistence and reproducibility. The `get_data` function acts as an intelligent wrapper, prioritizing local data loading to prevent redundant API calls, while also offering the flexibility to refresh data from Yahoo Finance when necessary. This systematic approach guarantees that all required raw data is consistently available for subsequent processing steps.

### 4.2 Data Cleaning and Understanding

Ensuring the quality and reliability of the dataset is paramount, and the `src/preprocessing.py` module is specifically engineered for this purpose. The `preprocess_pipeline` function within this module orchestrates a series of cleaning and feature engineering steps crucial for preparing time series data for modeling [1].

#### 4.2.1 Basic Statistics and Data Types

Before any transformations, understanding the basic statistics and data types of the raw data is critical. The `generate_summary` function in `preprocessing.py` provides a descriptive summary of the DataFrame, including key statistical measures and the identification of missing values. This summary is instrumental in quickly pinpointing potential issues such as skewed distributions, outliers, or columns with a high proportion of missing data. For instance, it helps confirm that the 'Date' column is correctly parsed as a datetime object and that numerical columns are indeed numeric, facilitating targeted cleaning efforts [1].

#### 4.2.2 Handling Missing Values

Financial time series data frequently contains missing values due to non-trading days or data collection anomalies. The `check_and_fill_missing` function in `preprocessing.py` addresses this through a robust methodology:

1.  **Reindexing to a full date range**: A complete business day index is created from the minimum to the maximum date in the dataset, ensuring all potential trading days are accounted for.
2.  **Forward-fill (`ffill`)**: Missing values are filled using the last valid observation, a common practice in time series to carry forward the last known price.
3.  **Backward-fill (`bfill`)**: Any remaining missing values (e.g., at the beginning of the series) are filled using the next valid observation, ensuring no `NaN` values remain. This comprehensive approach ensures a continuous time series, a prerequisite for many forecasting models [1].

#### 4.2.3 Normalization or Scaling

While the current `preprocess_pipeline` does not explicitly include normalization or scaling, the `log_adjclose` transformation (`df['log_adjclose'] = np.log(df['Adj Close'])`) is applied. This transformation helps stabilize variance and can make the series more stationary, which is beneficial for many time series models. For deep learning models like LSTMs, further scaling (e.g., Min-Max scaling or Standardization) would typically be applied to bring features to a similar range, preventing features with larger values from dominating the learning process [1].

### 4.3 Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is a critical phase for uncovering underlying patterns, trends, and anomalies. The `preprocessing.py` module, through its `preprocess_pipeline` function, integrates several steps that contribute to a comprehensive EDA [1].

#### 4.3.1 Visualization of Closing Price, Daily Returns, and Volatility

The `preprocess_pipeline` calculates `Daily_Return`, `Rolling_Mean`, and `Rolling_Volatility` features. While the script itself does not generate visualizations, these features are fundamental for understanding time series behavior. Visualizing the `Adj Close` price over time for each asset reveals overall trends, while plotting `Daily_Return` highlights periods of high and low volatility. The `add_daily_returns` function computes the percentage change in adjusted closing price, providing a clear measure of daily price fluctuations. The `add_rolling_features` function calculates rolling mean and volatility over a specified window (defaulting to 20 days), offering insights into short-term trends and fluctuations by smoothing out daily noise [1].

#### 4.3.2 Outlier Detection

Identifying outliers is crucial in financial data, as they can represent significant events or data errors. The `detect_outliers` function in `preprocessing.py` uses a Z-score based method to identify outliers in the `Daily_Return` column. A threshold (defaulting to 3) flags observations whose Z-score exceeds this value. Visualizing these outliers on a time series plot of daily returns helps pinpoint specific dates or events that led to extreme price movements, providing valuable context for understanding market dynamics and potential risks [1].

### 4.4 Seasonality and Trends

Understanding seasonality and trends is fundamental for time series forecasting. While visual inspection provides initial insights, statistical tests are necessary to formally assess these properties, particularly stationarity. A stationary time series has constant statistical properties over time, a common assumption for models like ARIMA. Raw closing prices are typically non-stationary, but daily returns are often stationary or can be made stationary through differencing. The `arima_model.py` implicitly handles differencing through the `d` parameter in the ARIMA order, which accounts for the integrated (I) part of the model, making non-stationary series stationary for modeling [1].

### 4.5 Analyze Volatility

Volatility analysis is a cornerstone of financial time series analysis, providing insights into the degree of variation of a trading price series over time. High volatility often indicates higher risk. The `preprocessing.py` module facilitates this analysis through the calculation of rolling statistics [1].

#### 4.5.1 Rolling Means and Standard Deviations

The `add_rolling_features` function computes rolling mean and rolling volatility (standard deviation) for a given window. These metrics are invaluable for understanding short-term trends and fluctuations, smoothing out daily noise and highlighting underlying patterns. For instance, a rising rolling standard deviation for TSLA would signal increasing risk, while a consistently low rolling standard deviation for BND would confirm its role as a stable asset. These rolling metrics are essential for visualizing how risk and return characteristics evolve over time [1].

### 4.6 Documenting Key Insights and Foundational Risk Metrics

Beyond raw data and preprocessing, Task 1 also includes documenting key insights and calculating foundational risk metrics. While the provided Python scripts lay the groundwork, comprehensive documentation of insights and calculation of advanced risk metrics like Value at Risk (VaR) and the Sharpe Ratio are typically performed in the analytical phase, likely within Jupyter notebooks [1].

#### 4.6.1 Overall Direction and Fluctuations

Analyzing the overall direction of asset prices involves observing long-term trends from the `Adj Close` series. Fluctuations in daily returns and their impact are assessed by examining the `Daily_Return` series and its volatility. Periods of high volatility, identified by rolling standard deviation and outlier detection, indicate heightened risk and potential for significant price swings. These observations are crucial for understanding historical asset behavior and informing future forecasting efforts [1].

#### 4.6.2 Value at Risk (VaR) and Sharpe Ratio

**Value at Risk (VaR)** quantifies the potential loss of an investment over a specified period at a given confidence level. For example, a 95% VaR of $1 million means there is a 5% chance that the investment could lose more than $1 million over the defined period. Calculating VaR typically involves analyzing the historical distribution of returns. While `preprocessing.py` provides the `Daily_Return` series, the actual VaR calculation involves statistical analysis on these returns, which is a standard practice in financial analysis [1].

**The Sharpe Ratio** measures risk-adjusted return, indicating the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility. A higher Sharpe Ratio implies better risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated as: 

$$ \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{E(R_p) - R_f}{\sigma_p} $$

Where:
-   $E(R_p)$ is the expected portfolio return.
-   $R_f$ is the risk-free rate.
-   $\sigma_p$ is the standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess return.

To calculate the Sharpe Ratio, historical daily returns, their standard deviation, and a chosen risk-free rate are needed. These calculations are performed during the analysis phase to assess historical risk-adjusted performance of individual assets or a portfolio. The `portfolio_optimization.ipynb` notebook would likely integrate such metrics to evaluate different portfolio compositions [1].

These foundational risk metrics provide quantitative insights into the risk-return profile of the assets, complementing qualitative observations from trend and volatility analysis. Their inclusion is vital for making informed decisions regarding portfolio adjustments and risk management [1].


## 5. Modeling and Forecasting

Accurate forecasting of financial asset prices is a cornerstone of effective portfolio management. This framework employs two distinct yet complementary modeling approaches: ARIMA for its statistical rigor in time series analysis, and LSTM for its advanced capabilities in capturing complex, non-linear patterns. Both models are integrated to provide robust predictive insights.

### 5.1 ARIMA Modeling

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models are a class of statistical models used for analyzing and forecasting time series data. The `src/arima_model.py` script and the `notebooks/arima_modeling.ipynb` notebook are dedicated to the implementation and exploration of ARIMA models within this framework. ARIMA models are particularly effective for data that shows evidence of non-stationarity, where differencing (the 'I' component) can be applied to make the series stationary before applying AR and MA components.

The `arima_model.py` script is designed to train and forecast using ARIMA models for the configured tickers (TSLA, BND, SPY). It encapsulates the logic for fitting the SARIMAX model, generating forecasts, and potentially evaluating their performance. The `arima_modeling.ipynb` notebook provides a more detailed, interactive walkthrough, allowing users to understand the nuances of ARIMA model development, including parameter selection (p, d, q), seasonality, and exogenous variables. The output of these models, such as `forecasts_arima_all.csv` and `metrics_arima_all.csv` in the `results/` directory, provides the predicted values and performance metrics, respectively.

### 5.2 LSTM Modeling

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks represent a significant advancement in time series forecasting, especially for financial data characterized by long-term dependencies and non-linear relationships. As a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), LSTMs are uniquely capable of learning from sequences of data, making them highly suitable for predicting future stock prices based on historical patterns. The `src/lstm_model.py` script and the `notebooks/lstm_modeling.ipynb` notebook are central to the LSTM implementation.

The `lstm_model.py` is expected to contain the architecture and training logic for the LSTM model, including data preparation specific to neural networks (e.g., sequence creation, normalization), model compilation, training, and prediction. The `lstm_modeling.ipynb` notebook guides users through the entire process of developing and applying LSTM models, from data preprocessing (which might involve additional scaling beyond what's in `preprocessing.py` to optimize for neural networks) to model evaluation. The results, such as `forecasts_lstm_all.csv` and `metrics_lstm_all.csv`, store the LSTM-generated forecasts and their corresponding performance metrics, allowing for a direct comparison with ARIMA models.

### 5.3 Forecasting Analysis

The `notebooks/forecasting_analysis.ipynb` notebook is designed for a comprehensive analysis of the forecasts generated by both ARIMA and LSTM models. This notebook would typically involve:

*   **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the performance of ARIMA and LSTM models using various metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared) to determine which model provides superior predictive accuracy for different assets.
*   **Visualization of Forecasts**: Plotting actual vs. forecasted prices, along with confidence intervals, to visually assess model accuracy and identify periods of significant deviation.
*   **Error Analysis**: Investigating the nature of forecasting errors to understand model limitations and potential areas for improvement.

This analytical phase is crucial for deriving actionable insights from the models and making informed decisions about which forecasting approach to rely on for subsequent portfolio optimization.


## 6. Portfolio Optimization

Portfolio optimization is a critical step in translating asset price forecasts into actionable investment strategies. This framework provides tools to construct optimal portfolios based on forecasted returns and risk, aiming to maximize returns for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a target return. The `notebooks/portfolio_optimization.ipynb` notebook and the `src/optimizer.py` module are key components in this process.

### 6.1 Principles of Portfolio Optimization

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), introduced by Harry Markowitz, forms the theoretical foundation for portfolio optimization. MPT suggests that investors can construct portfolios to maximize expected return for a given level of market risk, or minimize risk for a given level of expected return, by carefully choosing proportions of various assets. The core idea is diversification: combining assets whose returns are not perfectly positively correlated can reduce overall portfolio risk without sacrificing expected returns.

In this framework, the forecasted returns from the ARIMA and LSTM models serve as crucial inputs for the optimization process. The `src/optimizer.py` module is designed to implement various optimization algorithms, which might include:

*   **Mean-Variance Optimization**: This classic approach seeks to find the optimal allocation of assets by balancing expected portfolio return against portfolio variance (a measure of risk). It typically involves solving a quadratic programming problem.
*   **Risk Parity**: This strategy aims to allocate capital such that each asset or risk component contributes equally to the total portfolio risk. This can lead to more balanced portfolios compared to traditional market-cap weighted approaches.
*   **Black-Litterman Model**: This model combines the market equilibrium view with an investor's subjective views on asset returns, providing a more robust and intuitive approach to portfolio construction, especially when historical data might not fully capture future expectations.

### 6.2 Implementation in the Framework

The `portfolio_optimization.ipynb` notebook guides users through the process of applying these optimization techniques. It would typically involve:

1.  **Loading Forecasted Returns**: Utilizing the `forecasts_arima_all.csv` and `forecasts_lstm_all.csv` files from the `results/` directory as inputs.
2.  **Calculating Covariance Matrix**: Estimating the covariance between asset returns, which is essential for quantifying portfolio risk.
3.  **Defining Optimization Objectives**: Specifying whether the goal is to maximize the Sharpe Ratio, minimize volatility, or achieve a target return.
4.  **Applying Optimization Algorithms**: Using libraries like `PyPortfolioOpt` (as indicated in `requirements.txt`) to solve the optimization problem and determine the optimal asset weights.
5.  **Analyzing Optimal Weights**: Examining the `portfolio_weights.json` file (found in `results/`) which stores the calculated optimal asset allocations. This file would contain the proportion of capital to be allocated to each asset (TSLA, BND, SPY) to achieve the desired portfolio characteristics.

By integrating forecasting with optimization, the framework provides a powerful tool for investors to make data-driven decisions about their asset allocation, moving beyond simple historical analysis to forward-looking, model-driven strategies.



## 7. Backtesting Framework

Backtesting is a crucial step in validating the effectiveness and robustness of any quantitative trading or investment strategy. It involves testing a strategy on historical data to determine its hypothetical performance. This framework includes a dedicated backtesting module to rigorously evaluate the forecasting models and portfolio optimization strategies. The `src/backtester.py` script and the `notebooks/backtesting.ipynb` notebook are key components of this process.

### 7.1 Principles of Backtesting

Effective backtesting requires careful consideration of several factors to ensure reliable results:

*   **Data Integrity**: Using clean, accurate, and realistic historical data that reflects actual market conditions, including transaction costs and liquidity constraints.
*   **Avoiding Look-Ahead Bias**: Ensuring that the strategy only uses information that would have been available at the time of the decision. This means future data points should not influence past decisions.
*   **Realistic Assumptions**: Incorporating realistic assumptions about trading costs, slippage, and market impact to avoid overestimating performance.
*   **Statistical Significance**: Evaluating results using appropriate statistical measures to determine if the observed performance is genuinely due to the strategy or merely random chance.

### 7.2 Implementation in the Framework

The `src/backtester.py` module is designed to simulate the execution of investment strategies based on the generated forecasts and optimized portfolio weights. It would typically take the historical data, the forecasts, and the optimal portfolio weights as inputs and simulate the portfolio's performance over time. This simulation would involve:

1.  **Rebalancing the Portfolio**: Adjusting asset allocations periodically (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) according to the optimized weights derived from the `portfolio_optimization.ipynb` notebook and stored in `portfolio_weights.json`.
2.  **Calculating Portfolio Returns**: Aggregating the returns of individual assets based on their allocated weights to determine the overall portfolio return for each period.
3.  **Tracking Performance Metrics**: Recording key performance indicators throughout the backtesting period, such as:
    *   **Cumulative Returns**: The total return of the portfolio over the entire backtesting period.
    *   **Annualized Returns**: The average annual return, useful for comparing performance across different timeframes.
    *   **Volatility (Standard Deviation)**: A measure of the portfolio's risk.
    *   **Maximum Drawdown**: The largest peak-to-trough decline in the portfolio's value, indicating the worst-case loss from a peak.
    *   **Sharpe Ratio**: As discussed in Section 4.6.2, this risk-adjusted return metric is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of the portfolio.
    *   **Sortino Ratio**: Similar to the Sharpe Ratio, but only considers downside deviation (negative volatility), providing a better measure of risk for investors concerned about losses.

The `notebooks/backtesting.ipynb` notebook provides an interactive environment for conducting these backtests. It allows users to configure backtesting parameters, visualize portfolio performance against benchmarks (e.g., SPY), and analyze the various performance metrics. The results of the backtesting process are crucial for understanding the real-world applicability and potential profitability of the forecasting and optimization strategies, providing valuable feedback for further model refinement and strategy development.
